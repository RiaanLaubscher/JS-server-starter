### :radio_button: Project Stack
---

1. Frontend - Ionic React
2. State management - Apollo Client
3. **Integration - GraphQL API**
4. **Backend/Server - Express.js / Apollo Server / TypeGraphQL**
5. **Database - TypeORM/Postgres**

### :radio_button: Development Setup
---------

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). I have version 12.18.2 LTS installed on my system. Can be verified using `node -v` on the command line.
2. Visual Studio or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) works really well as code editors. Also download the following extensions:
    * Material Icon Theme extension (these just make your folder and file icons look cooler);
    * Prettier - Code formatter. The latter helps A LOT with formatting code by just pressing `CTRL + SHIFT + F`;
    * Apollo GraphQL - Syntax highlighting for GraphQL;
    * ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets - React and GraphQL snippets (if you want).
3. Clone this repo to your local PC using the version control software of your choice.
4. Jump into the repo and run `npm install` to install the dependencies listed in `package.json`.
