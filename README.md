### :radio_button: Development Setup
---------

1. Install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/). I have version 12.18.2 at the time of making this repo. Verify that it has been installed using `node -v` on the command line.
2. Install a code editor, Such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Install the Material Icon Theme and Prettier - Code formatter in the extensions section by pressing `CTRL + SHFT + X` in the code editor.
3. Clone this repo to your local PC using version control of your choice.
4. Jump into the repo and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
